# Java-Lab-Problems


# EXP 1 Programs on Selection and Iteration Statements

a Program to print Biggest of 3 Numbers if the numbers are not equal and also 
print whether the numbers are positive or negative or mixed numbers 

b Program to print first 10 numbers in Fibonacci series 

c Program to check a neon number (A neon number is a number where the 
sum of digits of square of the number is equal to the number. For example if 
the input number is 9, its square is 9*9 = 81 and sum of the digits is 9. i.e. 9 
is a neon number)

d Program to find the input number is palindrome or not. 

e Program to find the input number is a duck number or not using method ( A 
duck number contains zeros, but there should not be zero present in the 
beginning of the number. Eg., 3201, 1200)

# EXP 2 Arrays 

a Program to search an element of the array using for each loop 

b Program to sort an Array of elements in Ascending order 
 
c Create a Java class to enter number of students and their total marks. 
Compute and print the deviation in marks of each student against the 
average of marks of the class.

d Program to demonstrate passing objects as parameters

# EXP 3 Constructors and Methods

a Demonstrate different types of constructors 

b Create a Java Class “Shape” with constructor to initialize the one parameter 
“dimension”. Now create three sub classes of Shape with following methods 
(i) “Circle” with methods to calculate the area and circumference of the 
circle with dimension as radius. (ii) “Square” with methods to calculate the 
area and length of diagonal of the square with dimension as length of one 
side. (assuming length of each side of the square is same). (iii) “Sphere” 
with methods to calculate the volume and surface area of the sphere with 
dimension as radius of the sphere. Write appropriate main method to create 
object of each class and test every method.


c Demonstrate the different operations of Stack 

# EXP 4 Inheritance and Interfaces

a Program to demonstrate multi-level inheritance 

b Program to demonstrate multiple inheritance 

c Define an interface using JAVA that contains a method to calculate the 
perimeter of an object. Define two classes-circle and Rectangle with suitable 
fields and methods. Implement the interface “perimeter” in these classes. 
Write the appropriate main() method to create object of each class and test 
all the methods.


# EXP 5 Exception Handling 

a Design programs to demonstrate Exception handling mechanisms 

b Design a program to demonstrate user defined exception 

# EXP 6 this, super ,static, final key words

a program to illustrate the keywords i) this ii) super (using inheritance) 

b program to illustrate the i) static block ii) static variable iii) static method 
iv) final keywords


# EXP 7 Multithreading
a Programs for creating multiple threads a) Using Thread class b) Runnable 
Interface

b Create two threads in which one displays “Dept of CSE” for every 50 
seconds and the other displays “ Jain University” for every 100 seconds 
continuously.


# EXP 8 Applets and AWT 

a Design an Applet display the Sum of Two Numbers and set status message 
in Applet window 

b Draw Smiley in an Applet example.

c Design an applet for Bouncing of a Ball 

# EXP 9 Event Handling in JAVA 

a Create a Frame with a button having caption PRESS ME, once the button is 
clicked, the caption changes to PRESSED.

b Create an Applet with three text fields and a button. Input integer values in 
first two Text Fields. On Click of add button, the sum should be displayed in 
the third Text Field

c Create a swing applet that has two buttons named alpha and beta. When 
either of the buttons pressed, it should display “Alpha is pressed” or : "Beta is Pressed"
